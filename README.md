# To-Do-App

This is a project to start practicing fullstack coding.

## App description
The To-Do-App lets different users create their personal list of tasks with the options to
* edit,
* mark as done or mark as not done,
* delete.

Tasks marked as done automatically move to the back of the list and tasks that are not done yet can be shown separately.
